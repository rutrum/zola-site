Butler University has a program that encourages faculty to stay fit and active and reward them for doing so.  Healthy Horizons, among other things, allows faculty to log healthy habits in exchange for a prize if a number of points are reached.  Currently, faculty have to submit a handwritten sheet of paper containing all the healthy habits a faculty member did _over the course of the entire semester_.

A digital solution was needed, so Healthy Horizons came to Butler's EPICS program to find students willing to volunteer their time to develop such a solution.  I will be working on this project for a second semester this fall.
