[This site](https://rutrum.github.io/multiplication-table") was costructed as a visual aid for the development of the algorithm to calculate [values of _M(n)_](https://oeis.org/A027424).  I've basically copied much of the logic in the C++ implementation of this program in a much sloppier fashion, not to mention in JavaScript.  It has served well as a tool for generating graphics for presentations and as a sandbox for exploring shapes that can be optimized further.  You can read more about my mathematics research on the [research page](/research).
