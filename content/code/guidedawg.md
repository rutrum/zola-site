With a mobile app in development, visually impaired students will be able to navigate Butler's campus.

The Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired is right in Indianapolis.  Many years ago a group of students at Butler University developed an app to allow students at the school navigate their campus.  The project has since shifted to try and serve Butler.

This involves creating an app that will direct a user from any location on campus to any other location.  In addition, a website will be built for administrators to update information about routes through campus.

My role on the team is to design the database and create an API to serve route information to both the mobile app and administrative website.  The app has gotten [a lot of press](https://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/41470888/digital-dawg-to-help-butlers-visually-impaired) too.
