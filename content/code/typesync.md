Typing out the rules of baseball and the top 100 most common english words gets old.

At [BoilerMake VII](https://boilermake.org/) I and a couple peers decided to build a website that let's you test your typing skills on song lyrics of your choice.  We wrote a website in react and an api in python.  We leveraged the genius python library to use the genius api.  After completing a song, your time gets saved under your name and put on the leaderboards.

We plan on adding different typing mods to add variety to the tests.  But first, we actually need to put in the investment to host typesync.tech, the free domain we got at the hackathon.
