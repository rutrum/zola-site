## Who are you?

My name is Dave Purdum. I'm a senior at Butler University studying mathematics, computer science, and statistics. I'm interested in finding ways to apply all three of these disciplines through research, writing, and application development.


This my personal website, to hoot and holler about all things I like to do and learn.May it also be a springboard for future projects.

## What's to find here?

You can find my research projects at Butler University on the [research](./research) page.  In my free time I develop small applications that you can find in [code](./code).  You can also find my [resume](./resume) here as well.

## Why Rutrum?

Rutrum was the name of my first world of warcraft character (that I made in 2008) and has since been my online alias.  When I mistakenly named my github _rutrum_ instead of _davidpurdum_ many years ago, I felt like there was no turning back.
