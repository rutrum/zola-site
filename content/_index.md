# Dave Purdum

I'm a senior at Butler University studying mathematics, computer science, and statistics. I'm interested in finding ways to apply all three of these disciplines through research, writing, and application development.

## Why Rutrum?

Rutrum was the name of my first world of warcraft character (that I made in 2008) and has since been my online alias.  When I mistakenly named my github _rutrum_ instead of _davidpurdum_ many years ago, I felt like there was no turning back.
